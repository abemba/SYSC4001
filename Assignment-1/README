SYSC 4001 Assignment 1

Samuel Dewan - 1010*****
Chance Abemba - 1010*****



There is one makefile for both parts of the assignment. To build the assignment,
simply run make in the main directory. Both parts will be built in their respective
directories.

Part 2 accepts a single command line argument, the number of processes which should
be spawned. If no argument is provided it will default to 4 processes.
